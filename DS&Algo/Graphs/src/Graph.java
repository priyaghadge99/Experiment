//Main Execution is here with

*
*  A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in.
*  This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
Union: Join two subsets into a single subset. Here first we have to check
*  if the two subsets belong to same set. If no, then we cannot perform union.
*
* track of the subsets in a 1D array, letâ€™s call it parent[].
*
*
* 0   1   2
  -1 -1  -1
*
*
* Edge 0-1: Find the subsets in which vertices 0 and 1
*  are. Since they are in different subsets, we take the union of them
* 0   1   2    <----- 1 is made parent of 0 (1 is now representative of subset {0, 1})
  1  -1  -1
  *
  *
  * Edge 1-2: 1 is in subset 1 and 2 is in subset 2. So, take union.
  0   1   2    <----- 2 is made parent of 1 (2 is now representative of subset {0, 1, 2})
  1   2  -1

    * Edge 0-2: 0 is in subset 2 and 2 is also in subset 2. Hence, including this edge forms a cycle.
    How subset of 0 is same as 2?
    *
     0->1->2 // 1 is parent of 0 and 2 is parent of 1
