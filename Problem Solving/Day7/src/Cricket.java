//Q1.	Define a structure called cricket that will describe the following information
//Player name
//Team name
//Batting average
//Using cricket, declare an array player with 10 elements and write a program to read the information
// about all the 10 players and print a team wise list containing names of players with their battingaverage.
public class Cricket {
    public static void main(String[] args) {


    }
}


//java does not support struture and union complex data type
//you can achieve the same effect simply by declaring a class with the appropriate instance variables
